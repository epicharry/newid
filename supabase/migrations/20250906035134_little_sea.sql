  # Fix RLS Policies for Custom Authentication

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies that reference auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that work with anonymous access for signup
    - Allow anonymous users to create accounts
    - Restrict data access to authenticated users only

  2. Policy Updates
    - Allow anonymous INSERT for user registration
    - Require user context for all other operations
    - Maintain data isolation between users
